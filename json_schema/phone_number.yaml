title: 'Phone Number'
description: |
  represents a phone number in a way suitable as an API wire format
  - should not be used for locale-specific formatting of a phone number, such as
    "+1 (650) 253-0000 ext. 123"
  - is not designed for efficient storage
  - may not be suitable for dialing - specialized libraries (see references)
    should be used to parse the number for that purpose

  To do something meaningful with this number, such as format it for various
  use-cases, you will need a library like

        description: |
          A string representing an [E164][] number. 
          This property is formatted as a leading plus sign (`+`), followed by a phone
          number that uses a relaxed ITU E.164 format consisting of the country calling
          code (1 to 3 digits) and the subscriber number, with no additional spaces or
          formatting
          The ITU E.164 format limits the latter to 12 digits, but in practice not all
          countries respect that, so we relax that restriction here. National-only
          numbers are not allowed.

      extension:
        description: |
          **must not** include a leading "x" that services simply to
          indicate that the value is a phone number extension; this is implicit in the
          property itself.
        type: string
